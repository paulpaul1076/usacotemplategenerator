This is a template generator for train.usaco.org.

Before you compile this project with qt, go to source code and replace my ID ("paulpau2") with yours.

When you build the project you can deploy it by copying the .exe file to wherever you want, don't forget to add the necessary .dll files into that folder.

For windows users (don't know how to do it for other OS's):
After you have put the file into some directory, you can create a new "path" environment variable, so that you can run the executable from wherever you want.

How it works:
Simply type "usaco taskname" (without the quotes, of course) in your command prompt. (assuming that your executable is named "usaco"). 
It will create taskname.cpp, taskname.in, taskname.out files in the directory to which your command prompt is pointing.
